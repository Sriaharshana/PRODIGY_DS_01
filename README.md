World Bank Population Data Analysis ðŸ“Š
Project Description
This project involves analyzing the population dataset from the World Bank to explore population trends, clean the data, and create visualizations. The objective is to uncover insights and patterns from the population data, focusing on the top and bottom 10 countries by population. The analysis also includes the distribution of population sizes across countries and visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.

The project provides a clear overview of how population varies by country and presents a statistical summary of the data.
